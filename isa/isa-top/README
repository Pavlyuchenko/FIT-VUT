NAME
       isa-top - display real-time network traffic statistics by host

SYNOPSIS
       isa-top [-i interface] [-s b|p] [-t interval] [-c] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       isa-top  is  a  command-line tool that captures and displays real-time network traffic statistics for individual IP
       addresses. It monitors network interfaces using libpcap and calculates transmission rates for each captured connec‐
       tion. The statistics are displayed in an interactive terminal interface using ncurses, with automatic updates.

OPTIONS
       -i interface
              Specifies the network interface to monitor. If used without an argument, lists all available network  inter‐
              faces.

       -s b|p Sort output by:

              b      bytes per second (default)

              p      packets per second

       -t interval
              Sets the update interval for statistics in seconds (default: 1)

       -c     Show cumulative statistics over the entire duration of program execution

       -h     Display help message and exit

OUTPUT
       The program displays a table with the following columns:

       Source IP:Port
              Source IP address and port number

       Dest IP:Port
              Destination IP address and port number

       Proto  Protocol (tcp, udp, icmp, icmpv6, etc.)

       Rx b/s Received data rate in bits per second

       Tx b/s Transmitted data rate in bits per second

       Rx p/s Received packets per second

       Tx p/s Transmitted packets per second

              Data rates are automatically scaled to appropriate units (K, M, G).

EXAMPLES
       Monitor eth0 interface:
              isa-top -i eth0

       List available interfaces:
              isa-top -i

       Sort by packets per second:
              isa-top -i eth0 -s p

       Update every 5 seconds:
              isa-top -i eth0 -t 5

       Show cumulative statistics:
              isa-top -i eth0 -c

CONTROLS
       q, Q   Quit the program

EXIT STATUS
       0      Success

       1      Memory allocation error

       2      Threading error

       3      Command line argument error

       4      Packet capture error

NOTES
       The program requires root privileges.
