The state of the projects:  
* TCP: Finished. Testing didn't find any problems, public Discord server worked as expected. All areas should (hopefully) be functional.  
* UDP: Far from finished. Packet loss should be functional, messages are retried after a timeout. Packet delay/duplication is not functional. Sending messages and joining channels working locally, had issues when communicating with a remote server. Session initialization working without problems.
